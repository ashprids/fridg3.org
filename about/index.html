    As much as I regret to inform you all, my real name isn't actually Fridge.
    I know that would be REALLY awesome, but it just wasn't meant to be. My name's Ashton.
    <br><br>
    The origin of "fridge" comes from the name "doug", weirdly enough. I was in search
    for a cool looking name for my Steam account (after seeing someone called "doug" in a tf2
    video) and the name "fridge" came around somehow. I like how the word looks and how it sounds,
    so I stuck with it.
    <br><br>
    As for everything non-fridge, I was born in 2005 in Northern Ireland and I'm currently studying Cyber Security,
    though I'll possibly switch to a more programming-oriented career in the future (cus i like Python and I'm good at it).
    <br><br>
    I also occasionally do other things too! Such as this website, some music (which will be available here some other day!)
    I used to play osu!taiko like it's the only thing I'm good at (not too far off) and I (basically) run <a href="https://robloxforum.com">https://robloxforum.com</a> (est 2018).
    <br><br>
    I also really like <span style="color: #008080">this colour</span>.

  <p>
    fridg3.org was officially available to the public under its current domain on the 12th
    of January, 2024. It included a blog, a contact page and a credits page.
    <br><br>
    Here's what those pages looked like <i>(click on any image to enlarge)</i>:
    <br><br>
    <a href="1.png"><img src="1.png" alt="fridg3.org: Jan 12th 2024 (homepage)"></a><br>
    <a href="2.png"><img src="2.png" alt="fridg3.org: Jan 12th 2024 (blog)"></a>
    <br><br>
    The other pages weren't too much to look at, basically just the same thing with
    slightly different content. 
    <br><br>
    It was released with the first blog post, still available
    today! But it wasn't called a blog post, it was called a "chapter". I originally had this 
    idea of making my website some sort of alternate reality gig, but that idea grew old on me 
    over time.
    <br><br>
    The website used ASCII characters as shapes rather than containers until the rework later in the 
    year.
    <br><br>
    After a few months of changes, the final version of this style looked like this:
    <br><br>
    <a href="3.png"><img src="3.png" alt="fridg3.org: Jul 14th 2024 (homepage)"></a>
    <br><br>
    I'm still a huge fan of this design! But, <a href="/blog/06/">as mentioned in the blog</a>, 
    I wanted to make the website easier to work on and I wanted to go for a more minimal
    style, so I did just that on the 2nd of August, 2024.
    <br><br>
    And here we are today.
    <br><br>
    But did you know, the history of fridg3.org goes back even further than that?
    <br><br>
    There are three designs I came up with before the one in January 2024.
    The first one is the earliest, and also my first time using HTML and CSS to create
    a proper project. Here is a picture of the only completed page:
    <br><br>
    <a href="4.png"><img src="4.png" alt="An early blog prototype"></a>
    <br><br>
    I really like this one! It's minimal and has a cool flickering effect like a CRT monitor.
    <br><br>
    The second design I remember being quite complicated to make at the time.
    <br><br>
    <a href="5.png"><img src="5.png" alt="An early blog prototype"></a>
    <br><br>
    It was inspired from another website I wouldn't be able to find for the life of me.
    I'm not a huge fan of it looking back, but I must admit that the design is quite creative.
    I made it so you could drag the "window" around.
    <br><br>
    The third and final iteration is as follows:
    <br><br>
    <a href="6.png"><img src="6.png" alt="An early blog prototype"></a>
    <br><br>
    This one was inspired by the design of the first version of the website, but every page would look
    the exact same with different text in the box. The box was scrollable, but I still think it's too small 
    to be practical for things like images.
    <br><br>
    And that's the history of fridg3.org! I hope you enjoyed reading about it. You can access the early versions
    <a href="https://github.com/ashprids/Website-Designs">on this repository</a> and you're free to use them to inspire 
    your own projects. If you do so, send me a message via email or Discord and let me know, I'd love to know
    and help!
