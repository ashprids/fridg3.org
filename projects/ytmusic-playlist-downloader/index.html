    <br><br>
    YouTube Music Playlist Downloader is a command-line Python utility for downloading 
    YouTube Music Playlists with ID3 tagging (title, artist, album, cover, track number 
    and release date), using Spotify as a resource for metadata.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Requirements</h3>
   <h4>Spotify API</h4>
    You are required to provide your own Spotify Client ID and Secret. To obtain these, 
    go to https://developer.spotify.com/.
    <ol>
    <li>Log in, go to the dashboard and click "Create App"</li>
    <li>Fill in mandatory fields, ensure Redirect URIs has one URL</li>
    <li>Tick "Web API", then click "I understand..." and Save</li>
    <li>Go to your new app and click on "Settings"</li>
    </ol>
    This page will contain your Client ID and Secret.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Python setup</h3>
    <h4>(Don't worry about this unless you're running this from source code)</h4>
    Ensure the latest version of Python 3 is installed. To install required libraries, 
    clone the repository and run the following command:<br>
    <code>
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    </code><br><br>
    <h3>FFmpeg</h3>
    <h4>...is where the magic happens!</h4>
    FFmpeg comes with the Windows version of the software. Nothing to worry about!
    <br><br>
    If you're using Linux or running from source, you'll need to download it yourself.
    <ul>
        <li>On Linux, install FFmpeg through your package manager (e.g. <code>sudo apt 
        install ffmpeg</code>.)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    For Python, download FFmpeg from the official website https://ffmpeg.org/. You'll be 
    prompted to specify the path for the executable.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <h4>For Windows and Linux executables</h4>
    On Windows, go to Releases, then download and run the install.exe file.
    <br><br>
    On Linux, go to Releases and download the .tar.gz file. Extract it, then run the 
    install.sh script as sudo.
    <code><br>
    ~$ sudo sh ./install.sh
    </code><br><br>
    This will copy the executable to /usr/bin, and copy a shortcut to 
    /usr/share/applications.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <h4>How to get set up!</h4>
    On first run, the program will ask you for your Spotify Client ID and Client Secret. 
    Provide these as prompted. You can also specify a custom directory for playlists to be 
    placed.
    <br><br>
    You can then paste the URL for a YouTube or YouTube Music playlist. Specify a target
     bitrate in Kbps (e.g. 192, 320, etc.) and the program will do the rest.
    <li> For best quality (but larger file size), choose 320Kbps.</li>
    <br>
    In the event that the program cannot find the song on Spotify, you'll be notified and 
    only the title and artist metadata will be saved.
    <br><br>
    The program will generate a .m3u file as it downloads songs, this can be imported into 
    most music players to create the playlist automatically.

    <h3>Configuration</h3>
    <h4>Where your settings are stored</h4>
    Your settings (preferred download directory, API token, etc.) are saved in a location 
    depending on your OS.
    <ul>
    <li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\YTMusic-Playlist-Downloader</code></li>
    <li>Linux: <code>/home/YourName/.config/YTMusic-Playlist-Downloader</code></li>
    </ul>
    If you run the program without going through first-time setup, you'll be unable to run 
    the program again. Delete the YTMusic-Playlist-Downloader directory in these locations, 
    and try again.
    <br><br>
    <h3>Uninstall</h3>
    <h4>How to remove the program.. :(</h4>
    Linux users can uninstall the program by running <code>uninstall.sh</code> as root.
    <br><br>
    Windows users can uninstall by navigating to the install location (typically 
    <code>C:\Program Files\fridg3.org\YTMusic-Playlist-Downloader\uninstall.exe</code>).
    <br><br>
    <b>WARNING:</b> Your configuration file will not be deleted on uninstall! For security, 
    you should navigate to your configuration folder and delete it manually.
