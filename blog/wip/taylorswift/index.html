<h3>A short review of every Taylor Swift song</h3>
<h4>WIP | DDth Mon YYYY</h4>
As per someone's request, I want to present to you all a short
review for every album that Taylor Swift has published on YT music. I'm not actually much of 
a Taylor Swift fan (nor do I listen to music for its lyricism) so I'm far from the best 
person for this. But why not, right?
<br><br>
I'll be rating each song out of 5 stars based on factors I believe are relevant to the song 
itself. For example, if a particular song has powerful or well made instrumentals, I'll focus
on them whereas I might not so much with other songs.
<br><br>
So without further ado, let's begin!
<br><br>
<h3>Wait, hold on a moment.</h3>
<h4>There's actually a lot to cover...</h4>
Okay, so I actually have a life to live and I can't spend all my time writing reviews for songs, 
especially for an artist I don't consistently listen to. So I'll highlight what I classify as 
an album:
<ul>
    <li>Only original releases. Which means no "Taylor's Version" stuff, especially now that she has all the rights back to her music.</li>
    <li>Only one version of each album.</li>
    <li>Preferrably the shortest version of each album</li>
    <li>Only songs that are part of full-length albums.</li>
    <li>All of her "From The Vault" stuff included.</li>
    </ul>
Okay, now we have that out of the way, maybe we can get this post done in under 5 years.
<br><br>
<h3>Taylor Swift</h3>
<h4>Released 2006</h4>
<img src="1.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift Album Cover"><br><br>
<b><u>Tim McGraw</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>

Tim McGraw is a country artist I really don't know anything about. But what I do know is that Swift began as a country singer 
and this song is very esque of that. It's a very simple song that seems to be about happy memories with her + someone else.
Quite basic and nothing to really write home about (otherwise she'd be famous for this right?). Simple beginnings.
<br><br>
<b><u>Picture To Burn</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Never knew she made this song. I've also never heard more than 3 seconds of it. It's actually very oddly enjoyable, not terribly catchy which is a good thing 
because it means you won't hear it until you're sick of it. Guitar riffs are cool too! I like.
<br><br>
<b><u>Teardrops On My Guitar (Radio Single Remix)</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
This song is the second most popular, probably because it's about jealousy and literally everyone can relate to jealousy. 
The instrumentals hit all the right marks for a slow dance song, with that consistent rim shot during verses and the drums in general. 
There's also a good amount of emotion in the vocals at some parts, with her voice getting rougher. Overall a nice song, but nothing special in my 
opinion.
<br><br>
<b><u>A Place in this World</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Seeing an inconsistency with the capitalisation of the song titles, but whatever. This song has something about it that makes it very reminiscent of what my mum would 
listen to, but obviously this is far less emo. Is this song where the phrase "I'm just a girl" comes from? I like this song the most so far, very fun listen and reminds me 
of early 2000s pop. In a good, nostalgic way!
<br><br>
<b><u>Cold As You</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
The piano in this SCREAMS of early 2000s pop. I love it. There are some parts in the vocals where I'm not a huge fan and could've been mixed better (specifically "given to" in the chorus), but otherwise it's not 
too bad and quite enjoyable. The lyrics are definitely filled with some emotion and I love a display of emotion in any song.
<br><br>
<b><u>The Outside</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Nothing about this song really stands out to me to be honest. And my monkey brain can't really articulate the lyrics, so I can't enjoy this song as much as others.
The instrumentals are very basic and the vocals are quite bland. I don't really have much to say about this song, it's just not for me.
<br><br>
<b><u>Tied Together with a Smile</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Quite a nice, warm and fuzzy song. I enjoyed what was done with the lyricism here too. It's kind of like thinking about fire for some reason; where just the thought 
makes you feel warm inside. There's nothing I'd even say is particularly special about this, but it gives me warm vibes.
<br><br>
<b><u>Stay Beautiful</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
A lot of emotion in this one, I'd even go so far as to say it's a bit underrated with only 5.8m views on YT. Nothing particularly standout, and I'd prefer less repetitive lyrics, 
but it's a decent listen overall.
<br><br>
<b><u>Should've Said No</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
This one feels like the most effort was put into its instrumentals, particularly with the opening. It has that good repetitiveness that pop music should have, 
and with that banjo in the back, it really does feel like a country song. The lyrics are also quite relatable. Joking. I think.
<br><br>
<b><u>Mary's Song (Oh My My My)</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
The lyrics are slightly relatable at parts. Won't elaborate. Other than that, I don't have much to say 
and it's not too much of a standout song. Nothing amazing, but nothing terrible either. I'd be content if this was played around me.
<br><br>
<b><u>Our Song</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Lyrics in this one are quite good. I feel like they're relatable to a vast majority of people including myself, because it's a common love story.
The Irish-like instruments and guitars are also quite fun too. Good song.
<br><br>
<b><u>I'm Only Me When I'm With You</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Some clever lyricism in this one, especially with "I'm only up when you're not down, don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground". Good stuff. Bit more creativity with the instruments in this one too.
Overall a very enjoyable song because she's a lot more creative and her expressions are a lot more powerful I think.
<br><br>
<b><u>Invisible</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Probably the most different compared to the others, with the slow pacing and the whole "slow dancing" vibe. I enjoy the piano and her more airy vocals, but other than that 
I don't have too much to say.
<br><br>
<b><u>A Perfectly Good Heart</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
It's an alright song, but the lyricism is quite annoying and the creativity is definitely lackluster with this one. If it came on shuffle, I'd likely 
skip it. At this point the instrumentals are starting to sound the same to everything else here. Maybe this is last song bias? It's not terrible on its own, but it's not a wonderful album closer. 
Really not a good example of "go out with a bang".
<br><br><br>
<b><u>Overall</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br> 
It's a nice starting album and definitely has a good theme to it. There's however not much variety in the songs and nothing really sparks a flame to me. I know I shouldn't expect much since she 
began as a country singer, but I'm rating this as part of the rest of her discography, so it'll probably end up as the lowest rated album here.
<br><br>
Some goods, but for the mostpart the album as a whole isn't something 
I'd listen to again.
<br><br>
<h3>Fearless</h3>
<h4>Released 2008</h4>
<img src="2.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift Album Cover"><br><br>
<b><u>Fearless</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
With this album as a whole, you can definitely hear the tonal shift from country to pop, even if her Southern accent and some other element still remains. Album-titled track Fearless is a great welcome into this change, with an instantly catchy and iconic 
song that instantly defines the "Taylor Swift" sound for the time. The instrumentals are very well made, with the guitar riffs being very catchy and the vocals being very powerful too.
<br><br>
<b><u>Fifteen</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></i><br>
Quite a relaxing listen! Nothing too special, but I do particularly like how the vocals are more airy and the instrumentals are quite simple. Maybe the lyrics are relatable too? I can certainly see why someone would like this song, it's a common 
love story. Bonus points for being a 'non-chalant'? song.
<br><br>
<b><u>Love Story</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></i><br>
Another relaxing listen! I'd say this is one of her more iconic songs, as in I've heard this play on radio or on other people's playlists a decent amount of times. Guitars are quite catchy and the instruments work well together, with everything mixing together quite well without anything particularly trying to stand out.
<br><br>
<b><u>Hey Stephen</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
I enjoy the vocals in this one, especially the rhyme of "Hey Stephen" and "people always leaving". I think a rhyme like that takes a bit of craftsmanship to make it sound good, and it does. The instrumentals are also quite catchy, with the more unique use of rhodes? Makes it stand out as its own unique song instead of sounding like the rest of the album,
which was a problem with her first album.
<br><br>
<b><u>White Horse</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Not sure why I expected this one to sound like "Dark Horse" by Katy Perry, but it doesn't. This song is quite a nice listen, with the instrumentals being once again unique from the rest of the songs and the vocals being powerful. The lyrics are also quite fun to follow, with the whole fairy tale theme. Violins are also very sensual.
<br><br>
<b><u>You Belong With Me</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Relatable a little bit?? A teense? The whole "she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts" is an enjoyable lyric, and it certainly has the potential of being iconic. No particular instruments here that stand out to me, but the guitar riffs are still fun. Lyrics here being about how there's better fish in the sea are what make this a 5 star.
<br><br>
<b><u>Breathe</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Compared to the other songs, this one doesn't have that 'catchy' vibe to it, but on its own it's still an enjoyable listen. There are also more orchestral elements in this one that make me think of castles and hills or some shit like that. Not too bad. I also think it's ironic that she's talking about how she can't breathe without me, but I wasn't with her and she's clearly breathing to sing. Slightly misleading. :P 
<br><br>
<b><u>Tell Me Why</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
This is the least popular song in the album, which surprises me because it certainly has the pop catchiness that some more popular songs in this album are missing. There's also some parts where her vocals are a bit more ranged compared to her previous songs, and I'm a bitch for variation in vocals.
<br><br>
<b><u>You're Not Sorry</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Love the orchestral-ness of this one, especially in the beginning. For the rest of the song, there's nothing really notable that strikes out to me; the lyrics aren't much in terms of relatability (though i can see why some might like them) and the instrumentals after the beginning aren't much to write home about. The guitar riff mid-way through is fun though, which is what will be boosting this to 3 stars.
<br><br>
<b><u>The Way I Loved You</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>br>
A lot more raw emotion in the instruments at this time, and I like the vocals too. I might not have much to say about this one, but it's an enjoyable listen and the bridges before chrouses are definitely worth mentioning. Good orchestral stuff too.
<br><br>
<b><u>Forever & Always</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Really not a fan of her vocal range in this. She hits some high notes, but they aren't incredibly elegant. I think I'd prefer if she kept her vocals more airy and simple, like in the previous songs.
<br><br>
<b><u>The Best Day</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Something a bit more country-like, specifically in the lyrics. It's very chill, she isn't doing anything crazy and her voice is quite calm throughout. Nothing to write home about but it's a nice passive listen. It has that "nostalgic" vibe to it.
<br><br>
<b><u>Change</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
She seems to know how to make album closers now! Good for her. A good closer at that, it suits being the end of a story, even though this album doesn't tell a single specific story. Good instrumental parts, and fun riffs.
<br><br><br>
<b><u>Overall</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i>
<br>
She's made some improvements from her first album, with a few songs that are big hits for me while some are misses that I can happily live without hearing again. It still has that overall similar sound to it, but this time it's in a genre that I feel I can bare to listen to a little bit more. Not too bad.
<br><br>
<h3>Speak Now</h3>
<h4>Released 2010</h4>
<img src="3.jpg" alt="Taylor Swift Album Cover"><br><br>
<b><u>Mine</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
FINALLY SOME ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS!!!!!!!!!!!! NOW WE'RE SLIGHTLY MORE MY SPEED. You might be able to pick up on very subtle synth tracks in the background, and I quite like that. As for aspects of songs that other people care about, it's a perfect example of a pop song with the electronic aspects, cool vocals and.. wait. The vocals have... layering??? Wow the artistic development is getting somewhere! Great start to an album, big fan.
<br><br>
<b><u>Sparks Fly</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
I'm sensing more confidence in her vocals now. I'd be shouting too if I was as successful as her. One day. This is another four-star because much like Mine, I was intrigued for the whole duration of the song and didn't have that small voice in the back of my head telling me to skip prematurely, which was prevalent more often in the older albums. Nothing where I was like "wowie!!!" though, especially compared to Mine.
<br><br>
<b><u>Back To December</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></i><br>
Compared to the previous two, this feels a bit less stimulating. The instrumental is nice, but it doesn't quite capture my attention in the same way. Her vocals are still strong, but the song overall feels a bit more subdued. I'm also now learning that this song is one that's quite popular amongst fans so please don't hurt me. I have very subjective tastes. I'd do something about it if I could.
<br><br>
<b><u>Speak Now</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Hey she said the thing. I quite enjoy listening to the rim hits in the drumbeat at the beginning. Can't go wrong with a rim hit. Percussion is a really important aspect to me, and I can happily listen to a percussively genius song even if the other elements suck ass, so it's an easy four star with that alone. The "ooh ooh" sounds are cool during the chorus and some vocal stuff she does in bridges is interesting too!
<br><br>
<b><u>Dear John</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Hey Stephen. Dear John. Someone needs to remind Taylor she's allowed to write letters or something. The pacing and sound of this song isn't really my tempo, but it's not unlistenable to any degree. Just don't expect me to put it in any playlist of mine.
<br><br>
<b><u>Mean</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Back to the country sounds with a bit of a 'mature' twist? I can't describe what I mean but I know what I mean. Four stars for the use of violins (i like violins) and some cool guitar stuff that happens throughout that sounds difficult to do but also cool.
<br><br>
<b><u>The Story Of Us</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
That's not a typo, it's a six-star song. Why? Well, Mine deserves five stars but at the same time, this song feels a whole tier above that. I'm an electronic song enjoyer, and she went NUTS with the synth sounds here. The percussion (snare specifically) is also orgasmically punchy. I'd even go so far as to say this would go in my <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/29vVrJbPim7Nit2O2UQIjV?si=b90864d31b5a4d30">fridgependium</a> playlist. I know, big deal. Overall great sounding song. And the 'the end' thing at the end is very edgy. Cool. Cool. Very cool, very nice.
<br><br>
<b><u>Never Grow Up</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Same story with Dear John, to be honest. Just a bit more subdued and less engaging for me personally. I don't have much to say I'm afraid.
<br><br>
<b><u>Enchanted</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Cool pads throughout. We haven't heard a pad yet! It hit the marks for me as an emotion-provoking song due to its gradual introduction of various instruments. And then BOOM! The chorus, which... I'm whatever on to be honest. Four stars for cool pads and sexy progression.
<br><br>
<b><u>Better Than Revenge</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Taylor Swift was feeling like an indie band in this one. Nice! And the mid EQ'd vocals give it a nice touch. Very rock-like structure and sound, which make it stand out considerably from the rest so far. Quite the enjoyable listen, maybe even for someone who doesn't draw Taylor's name in blood on their arms.
<br><br>
<b><u>Innocent</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Another not-my-tempo track, but I'll give this one extra credit because the drums sound sick. Can imagine taking this song and adding a drum break on top of it, then republishing it in my own five-song album.
<br><br>
<b><u>Haunted</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
I feel like every time I say "not my tempo", some divine intervention occurs to make the next song exactly my tempo. This song's a good example of that I reckon. Emotional orchestral elements, some cool haunting chords and other sounds that really know how to set the theme of 'haunting'. I'm oddly not used to that happening in songs so this really stands out.
<br><br>
<b><u>Last Kiss</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
Every album has that one song that makes me think it was added to extend the duration of the album to meet some sort of quota. With a song that extends to 6 minutes without much variation or development, you can see why this one feels a bit bloated. Not a fan, sorry guys.
<br><br>
<b><u>Long Live</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
A very finisher-style finishing song. It has that epic feel to it, like a grand finale. The instrumentation builds up nicely and the lyrics are all about celebrating moments and memories. Yes I know, talking about lyrics like the madman I am. Definitely a strong closer for the album. Cool percussion too!
<br><br><br>
<b><u>Overall</u></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><br>
The electronic-sounding songs really carry this album to a solid 4 star rating. The instrumentals are a lot more varied and the vocals are a lot more powerful, with some songs being very catchy and enjoyable. I can see why this is one of her more popular albums, and I can see why people like it. If this album were a burger, I'd enjoy it as much as I enjoy the Big Whopper.
