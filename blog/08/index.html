<h3>Reclaiming The Desktop</h3>
<h4>08 | 03rd Nov 2024</h4>
The computer desktop is where everyone spends all their time on a computer 
(unless their computer is severely broken and they're trying to get it to 
boot again).
<br><br>
In my opinion, it's not worth using a desktop unless you have 
liberty over every single part of it, so I've decided to take back control 
with my own customizations and preferences.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
For many people, their operating system is just a gateway to Google Chrome. 
They don't really care what OS they're using, as long as it launches a web 
browser and whatever else they need to do as effortlessly as possible, which 
makes Windows the standard choice.
<br><br>
Windows is great for running everything you need it to, but it's very limited 
when it comes to personalisation and it takes using a more controllable OS 
to realize how much you're missing out on. When I tried Linux for the first 
time, I went for the Pop!_OS distribution and it made me aware of how much 
I could actually do with my experience.
<br><br>
Linux allows you to make a choice over things you'd never even consider on 
Windows or MacOS, such as how titlebars look, how program windows present 
themselves and how the taskbar at the bottom of your screen behaves. Since 
my discovery of Linux, I've been using distributions of it since 2021 and 
I've valued the desktop experience more than anything.
<br><br>
Recently, I've decided to go the full mile and I've opted for fully 
customizing my desktop from scratch. That includes customizing my own 
theme, taskbar, and everything else that makes up the desktop.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Options</h3>
I knew that if I wanted as much control as possible, I'd have to opt for a 
distribution of Linux that comes with nothing out-the-box. I felt that Arch 
Linux is the most suitable, because its easy install script allows you to 
make preference choices unheard of on other distros while also not being too 
much hassle to install.
<br><br>
For the first time, I also went for i3 as a window manager. i3 is a tiling 
window manager, which means that windows are automatically resized to fill 
the entire screen as they appear. It's a keyboard-heavy solution, which means 
I'll be setting up keybinds in a text file to control the windows and to start 
applications. I'll also be removing titlebars for maximum space efficiency. 
Compared to a floating window manager (which is what Windows uses), I much 
prefer this workflow.
<br><br>
There are also many options for the taskbar at the bottom (including not 
having one!) so I opted for Polybar. Polybar uses a text file for setting 
up various displays and buttons that serve multiple purposes, from displaying 
the time in a custom format to displaying your download/upload traffic live. 
To compensate for the missing titlebars, I'll also be adding a text bar to 
Polybar that'll display the name of the focused window.
<br><br>
Since it's likely I won't have a dedicated button on my Polybar for launching
applications, I'll add a keybind to my i3 configuration that launches dmenu, 
a minimalistic search option that allows you to launch any executable on the 
system (regardless of whether or not a shortcut is set up for it). This also 
removes the need to set up these shortcuts myself.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Final results</h3>

<h4>Click image to view full size</h4>
After spending some hours customizing i3, dmenu and Polybar with colour schemes, 
keybinds, fonts and functionality, I've accomplished a result I'm really 
happy with.
<br><br>
My chosen font is IBM VGA 8x16, the same font I use for code snippets on this 
website and the font used site-wide before the redesign. The icons on the 
Polybar come from Siji, a font that provides many icons for different purposes.
<br><br>
The volume indicator can be scrolled on to change the volume, and clicking on 
it will toggle mute. The time can also be clicked on to toggle a display of the 
date.
<br><br><br>
<h3>Afterword</h3>
If you'd like to see the configuration of this theme yourself, all customization 
options are available on <a href="https://github.com/ashprids/dotfiles" target="_blank">this GitHub page.</a>
<br><br>
I'd also recommend having a look at the subreddit <a target="_blank" href="https://reddit.com/r/unixporn">r/unixporn</a>, where you can find a 
whole community of people customizing their desktop just like me! Maybe one day, 
we'll all reclaim our desktops and be happy :)
