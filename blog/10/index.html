<h3>I make music btw</h3>
<h4>10 | 27th Dec 2024</h4>
Music is awesome. It seems weird to say that there was a time, not long ago, when music wasn't
a big part of the human life. But in the modern day, it can not only be heard everywhere, but it now also 
influences our emotions, opinions and maybe even our actions.
<br><br>
Music is very likely to be the only form of media that could outlive the rest. In the fall of humanity as a result of apocalypse,
music would still remain as prevalent as it is today. No other form of media could say the same.
<br><br>
I feel quite close to the music I listen to, I view it as art. I think it's only human nature to see something amazing, and 
want to replicate it. 
<br><br>
So, I make music. I've been making music for a few years now, and I've learnt a lot about the 
processes and compositions of songs, and how they can be used to convey emotions and stories.
<br><br>
..I mean, I say that, but in reality I'm just making music because it sounds good. And that's really 
all music needs to be, in my opinion. There are only so many emotions; if you focus too much on your song's meaning, you'll end 
up creating the same song we've heard a million times before. See Taylor Swift.
<br><br>
Music means MORE to me than emotion. I enjoy music the most when the melody is so angelic it gives
me goosebumps. I enjoy music the most when the beat is so catchy it makes me want to dance. I enjoy music the most when the lyrics
are treated as an instrument, rather than the instruments being a backdrop to the lyrics.
<br><br>
But enough about all that, you're CLEARLY here to listen to MY music. After all, this is fridg3.org! You're here for ME!
<br><br>
<h3>The Music page has been added!</h3>
<h4>Listen to my songs or check out my playlists!</h4>
You'll see at the top of each page that there's a new link: "music". 
Click on it to be taken to the music page, where you can listen to my music and playlists! Awesome!
<br><br>
All of my songs have their own unique pages where you can view the full-resolution album art, download the song, find which platforms
it's available on, and even view some lore and my thoughts behind the song!
<br><br>
I've even made a new preview element, which is a small audio player that you can use to listen to the song in your browser!
Here's an example of what it looks like:
<br>
<div class="audio-player">
    <audio id="audio" src="/music/cactile/digitalpirates/audio.mp3"></audio>
    <button id="play-pause" class="play">
        <i id="play-icon" class="fa-solid fa-circle-play"></i>
        <i id="pause-icon" class="fa-solid fa-circle-pause" style="display: none;"></i>
    </button>
    <input type="range" id="seek-bar" value="0">
    <span id="current-time">0:00</span> / <span id="duration">1:49</span>
</div>
<script src="/music/audioplayer.js"></script>
<a href="/music/cactile/digitalpirates/" id="songname">Digital Pirates - Cactile</a>

<br><br>
Beautiful, right? I'm so proud of it. I'm not sure how it performs from an online webpage (I test the website locally)
so if it ends up being slow or laggy, let me know and I'll consider making the previews lower-quality.
<br><br>
I've also made a playlist section, where you can view all of my playlists and listen to them
on their original platforms. You can see their genres below their names.
<br><br>
I hope you enjoy the music page! I've put a lot of effort into it, and I'm really proud of how it turned out. If you particularly like the
music, send an email to me and share with your friends!
<br><br>
Oh, and for those curious, Cactile is a name I used to go by before Fridge. I'll likely release music in the future under a different name.
<br><br>
This is the biggest update to the site I've made so far. Over 53 files have been published at once!
Thanks for reading, and have a good rest of the year!
