<h3>Website redesign!</h3>
<h4>06 | 02nd Aug 2024</h4>
Hello all, and welcome to the new and redesigned fridg3.org! I've decided
to revamp the website for a design style that's more cross-platform and eye 
friendly. I've always been a fan of minimalistic designs, and I feel like I've
hit the nail on the head with my choices here. I hope you all enjoy the new look!
<br><br><br>
<i>hmm ok... why?</i>
<br><br>
First of all, the old design looked cool and everything but I started finding it
difficult to read the text on mobile devices due to font size (and to be honest, I
much prefer this font for readability). Plus, the old design kinda grew old on me.
<br><br>Also, the layout of this site is now
much easier for me to work with, and thanks to the theming it's easier for you to
read as well.
<br><br><br>
<i>b...but my eyes!! they burn!!!!!</i>
<br><br>
Worry not! See the little sun icon in the top right corner? Click it to switch to
a dark theme! It'll turn into a moon icon, and clicking it again will switch back.
The theme is fully implemented and everything should change with the touch of a
button (minus the images, of course).
<br><br><br>
<i>the old blog posts still use the old design!</i>
<br><br>
Yeah I know. The HTML on those pages use CSS tags and specific formatting that would
take me ages to update. I personally don't consider it a good use of my time. Plus,
it's a nice little time capsule :)
<br><br><br>
<i>so.. the new design benefits you more?</i>
<br><br>
Yah. This design is much easier for me to work with because, unlike the old, I don't 
need to write 50 trillion CSS lines for new elements like bullet points or tables to
look good. If you have a look at the HTML for this page, you'll see there's actually
not much going on.
<br><br>
Also, working with ASCII shapes got a bit annoying after a while. The novelty wore
off, and it forced me to use an odd amount of characters for objects inside of boxes
otherwise the boxes broke. Plus the boxes always broke on smaller screens.
<br><br><br>
<i>you've changed the name of some pages... will links break?</i>
<br><br>
Afraid so.. I don't consider setting up redirects worth my time because there weren't 
many pages to begin with, and barely anywhere linking to them. I believe the link 
changes are intuitive enough to not cause any confusion.
<br><br>
Here are the changes:
<ul>
    <li>/extras/ -> /projects/</li>
    <li>/chapters/ -> /blog/</li>
    <li>/credits/ -> moved to homepage</li>
    <li>/gallery/ -> removed</li>
</ul>
I've decided to remove the gallery because I didn't really use it, and I don't think
I would've in the future at all since most pictures I take aren't really display 
worthy. Plus, it was a pain to add new images.
<br><br><br>
<i>alright awesome im out i guess</i>
<br><br>
ok bye!!! thanks for reading my blog, and i hope you stick around :)
