<h3>I wrote this blog post while drunk</h3>
<h4>14 | 11th Jul 2025 (written April 19th 2025)</h4>
Humans have evolved from slimy green amoeba to vicious prey-hunting [noun here] so we could fully satiate our thirst 
for knowledge through the means of exchanging information. Which is great news for you, dear reader, because knowledge 
is the only thing I enjoy sharing with other people. If my flatmates are reading this, please take what I'm saying to 
heart. No, you can not "borrow my cereal". Piss off and stop asking.
<br><br>
I have learnt more than the average human because not only do I cling to knowledge like the flesh does the knife 
(shoutout Rabbit Junk for that line, banger band) (music would go hard rn) but I absorb it and comprehend it on a 
level that far surpasses subconscious understanding. We tend to refer to our understanding of a subject based on 
how much we're aware about it, but in reality most of what we learn is absorbed through sub-conscious intelligence. 
We don't know more than half of what we know, simply because we don't understand ourselves.
<br><br>
How does one understand themselves? Is it as simple as thinking "yes, I understand now" or do we need to go back to 
the roots of social cues and status quo so we can really realise what makes us react to things the way we do? Well, 
great news, because I know the answer. It's the second thing.
<br><br>
I grew up learning about the ways we need to interact with each other to be socially acceptable at a late stage in 
my childhood, which has enabled me to utilize my late-stage self-awareness for comprehending every choice I make. 
For some, taking that of which is an innate behaviour and making it fully conscious is an unwise and impractical 
resolve, because suddenly they need to worry about ideas and concepts that they never even considered to be a real 
factor in how we communicate. But I believe that it's allowed me to understand human activity at a greater level than 
most humans, which might even imply I can consciously communicate and interact with people in ways that result in a 
desirable outcome for me.
<br><br>
Perhaps that's what defines a manipulator; a person capable of understanding what others can't about themselves so 
they can manipulate the outcome of an interaction to their advantage without anyone else knowing it. I mean, take 
"pick a card" card tricks, does it not take a further understanding of human psychology to accurately predict patterns 
in how humans think, resulting in making a choice that'll grant you the card chosen by a peer?
<br><br>
Perhaps pretending to understand ourselves is what'll drive us to an ego death (and I don't mean a psychedelic one, 
unless I do, idk i dont understand those fully) so maybe I should keep my thoughts locked away and go to sleep so I 
don't hurt myself.
<br><br>
But then again, with all that knowledge hidden away, we miss the opportunity of granting it to someone who knows how to 
use it for great things.
