I know I'm releasing this blog post slightly late, but I wanted to leave a bit more time between my last post and other things just unfortunately took up my time. If it helps to know, I wrote this post during my second listen of the album.
<br><br>
So, is there album as good as the rest? Can they hold up to the high standards set by their previous releases? Let's go on an adventure and find out together, my friends. Listen along and enjoy!
<br><br>
<h3>Driver</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Loved the transition to this from Immersion. Starting from a man drowning to his immersion (haha get it) and then hitting hard with some solid drops and dirty bass. A great was to start the album and mark a new era for Pendulum.
<br><br>
<h3>Come Alive</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
I vividly remember this releasing during the covid pandemic as part of the Elemental EP, and wow what a banger it was then and now. What a unique sounding song! Far different from their other songs to that point.
<br><br>
<h3>Save The Cat</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
I feel special things with this song. Such an emotional song I can only describe as "absolutely bleeding". Does that even make sense? I don't know. But I love this song regardless, and Rob's vocal development is so strongly present here in this. Would love to hear more from him doing these screamo style vocals (and we did, when he sang Self Vs Self live in Milton Keynes! What an honour to be there).
<br><br>
<h3>Archangel</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Easily one of the best songs in this album. Pendulum have really nailed down on making songs sound epic and emotional at the same time. The perfect soundtrack for a season finale. So worth the wait. Love this song more than I love milk. And I LOVE milk.
<br><br>
<h3>Nothing For Free</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Hearing this during covid, it felt foreign compared to their other songs and honestly, I still feel the same about it now. It feels distant from their current works, especially with the relatively weaker bass. Do I hate it? No! But, there's definitely stronger contenders in this album and in their discography.
<br><br>
<h3>Cannibal</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Loved Wargasm's vocals on this song, the pair did wonders on this track. As for the instrumental, I feel like there's things missing that the other songs shine bright in. I'd say this track is similar to Nothing For Free in that manner. Rob Swire's vocals did a great job here though. Solid 4 star rating.
<br><br>
<h3>Constellations</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Hey, this is a transition track. I was kinda disappointed to hear about this, and the same goes for The Endless Gaze, because these would be absolutely AWESOME names for full length tracks. I feel like this transition isn't perfect for Halo either. Honestly? It feels weak.
<br><br>
<h3>Halo</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Bullet For My Valentine was such a hype collaborator when this song came out as a part of the Anima EP. The melodies are epic, the festival vibes are wonderful and everything about this track hits right. Honestly, I have no complaints.
<br><br>
<h3>Louder Than Words</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
For the first 6 months when this song came out as a part of Elemental, I honestly didn't like this track that much. It felt too much like a basic liquid DNB track, and nothing about it felt exciting or riveting like Pendulum's tracks tend to be. Listening back today, I've warmed up to the track and it's not terrible, but I'd honestly skip it if it came up on shuffle. Just one of those tracks, y'know?
<br><br>
<h3>Napalm</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
What a great way to start a concert. Being one of the first people to hear this on the 2024 tour starting with Leeds was an honour. What a great concert (I think, at least. I was drunk to the point of forgetting). A strong party people anthem, and it goes crazy for setting the mood for a night of tunes and bangers.
<br><br>
<h3>The Endless Gaze</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
What do the lyrics mean? What was Rob trying to convey? Beats me, I'm illiterate. But I can say that the transition into the next track isn't absolutely terrible. An improvement from Constellations. Not bad.
<br><br>
<h3>Guiding Lights</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Ah yes, one of those tracks we've been waiting like 5 years to release. (Sorry You're Not A Winner remix next please) it's a song I've learnt to warm up to, and much like Save The Cat (which is funny because they both mention lines relating to losing a friend) this song warmed up to me quickly after a few plays. A strong contender for best song in the album, but trust me my friends. You haven't heard the best of it yet.
<br><br>
<h3>Colourfast</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Sorry to say it, but uh... that last line wasn't a transition to talk about how this songs the best. Still a great song though! Very reminiscent of the Immersion era of Pendulum. Massive party banger, great sounding everything. Can't complain, honestly. Doesn't sound like a class S masterpiece but it does the job.
<br><br>
<h3>Silent Spinner</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
I was in LOVE with this song when it came out with Anima. I still think this song hits really hard, and I can't help but orgasm to the sound of that BASS when I listen to this with headphones. MY GOD THE BASS. I'd pray to the bass line if it was a god. What a strong hitting riff.
<br><br>
<h3>Mercy Killing</h3>

Honestly, I'm not a huge fan of Scxrlxrd's contributions to this song. But my opinion might entirely be based on his appearance in the 2024 tour, because he just didn't feel that strong compared to Rob Swire's appearance. I might be biased in that fact. While the song sounds great, Scxrlxrd just isn't my vibe. But I'll give a generous 3 stars for every other factor.
<br><br>
<h3>Cartagena</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
Seven stars. Yep. Seven. Seven whole fucking stars. I LOVE this song. I would marry this song. I would leave freezer for this song. Well not really but they'd actually have to agree on having shifts with me. This is BY FAR Pendulum's best track SO FAR, in my opinion. The best of the best. The MVP. The number one to rule amongst them all. My god, how emotional, melodic, and just BEAUTIFUL this track is. I was close to tears hearing this for the second time. I can't believe I only ranked this song 4th when I first listened. You guys NEED to listen to this. It's SO GOOD and it works SO WELL as an album closer. What an album. Great job Pendulum, you've won my heart with this one. I'm SO happy you guys didn't release this one before release day.
<br><br>
<h3>Overall</h3>
<h4><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></h4>
You know what? If I listened to all of these songs for the first time on release day, I probably would've started crying. Cartagena really does carry the whole album into greatness now that I've worn and torn most of the others. You guys mind if I cry a bit? Thanks. Appreciate it.
<br><br>
Banger album from Pendulum and I expected nothing less. Thank you for making tracks all these years and being the special place in my heart that makes me want to listen to you 50 times a day. What a great way to convey emotion. I love music. You inspire me to make my own, so please never stop!
